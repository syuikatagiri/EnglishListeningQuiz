Yesterday, we went to the zoo for the first time
I have many interesting ideas for the future
The group traveled from New York to Chicago by bus
We should try to save more money in the future
Larry looked at me in a very unusual way
In fact, I really like this music
Everyone must work together in order to save the environment
The economy will get better in the near future
